# ðŸ”¥ Firecrawl

Crawl and convert any website into LLM-ready markdown. Built by [Mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai?ref=gfirecrawl) and the firecrawl community.

_This repository is in its early development stages. We are still merging custom modules in the mono repo. It's not completely yet ready for full self-host deployment, but you can already run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required.

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

## How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://firecrawl.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if you'd like.

```

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

crawl_result = app.crawl_url('mendable.ai', {'crawlerOptions': {'excludes': ['blog/*']}})

# Get the markdown
for result in crawl_result:
    print(result['markdown'])
```

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape_url` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

```python
url = 'https://example.com'
scraped_data = app.scrape_url(url)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydanti schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python
class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int 
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):
    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., max_items=5, description="Top 5 stories")

data = app.scrape_url('https://news.ycombinator.com', {
    'extractorOptions': {
        'extractionSchema': TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema(),
        'mode': 'llm-extraction'
    },
    'pageOptions':{
        'onlyMainContent': True
    }
})
print(data["llm_extraction"])
```

### Search for a query

Performs a web search, retrieve the top results, extract data from each page, and returns their markdown.

```python
query = 'What is Mendable?'
search_result = app.search(query)
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL with error handling, use the `scrapeUrl` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

```js
try {
  const url = 'https://example.com';
  const scrapedData = await app.scrapeUrl(url);
  console.log(scrapedData);

} catch (error) {
  console.error(
    'Error occurred while scraping:',
    error.message
  );
}
```


### Crawling a Website

To crawl a website with error handling, use the `crawlUrl` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

```js
const crawlUrl = 'https://example.com';
const params = {
  crawlerOptions: {
    excludes: ['blog/'],
    includes: [], // leave empty for all pages
    limit: 1000,
  },
  pageOptions: {
    onlyMainContent: true
  }
};
const waitUntilDone = true;
const timeout = 5;
const crawlResult = await app.crawlUrl(
  crawlUrl,
  params,
  waitUntilDone,
  timeout
);

```


### Checking Crawl Status

To check the status of a crawl job with error handling, use the `checkCrawlStatus` method. It takes the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job.

```js
const status = await app.checkCrawlStatus(jobId);
console.log(status);
```



### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:
 
```js
import FirecrawlApp from "@mendable/firecrawl-js";
import { z } from "zod";

const app = new FirecrawlApp({
  apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY",
});

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe("Top 5 stories on Hacker News"),
});

const scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl("https://news.ycombinator.com", {
  extractorOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },
});

console.log(scrapeResult.data["llm_extraction"]);
```

### Search for a query

With the `search` method, you can search for a query in a search engine and get the top results along with the page content for each result. The method takes the query as a parameter and returns the search results.

```js
const query = 'what is mendable?';
const searchResults = await app.search(query, {
  pageOptions: {
    fetchPageContent: true // Fetch the page content for each search result
  }
});

```
